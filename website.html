                This is my portfolio! This is still in a work-in-progress. Nevertheless this website will deplay the first steps in understanding a userâ€™s experiences. 
                In this assignment we were tasked with observing real users interacting with an interface and interviewing these individuals about their experiences. 
                Furthermore, we were asked to create personas based on these users, and illustrate a storyboard for one of our personas.

                The Interface I choose to incorporate for this assignment were the newly installed Washing Machines within Machado House. I choose this due to the range of impressions these new new machines have left on Machado residents.

                Recorded Observations
            </h2>
            <p>
                After spending 10-20 minutes witnessing friends attempt to use the newly installed machines in Machado House I made the follow observations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>People take a considerable amount of time examing the new machines ane the nely added stickers</li>
                <li>People seem to have trouble paying for the machines</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> People enter the correct machine ID or machine number and ultimately end up receiving an error from the payment box
                        <li> Machine numbers were entered multiple times
                    </ul>
                <li>People pack a lot of clothes in the washer and this often breaks the washers</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> This is made worse by the fact that washers are considerably smaller than dryers
                    </ul>
                <li> Wait times are unpredictable...its difficult to guage how much time your clothes will take to finish washing
            </ul>

            </h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>What do you think about the new machines?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The new machines are much cleaner</li> 
                    <li>Many are optimistic and hope the machines don't breakdown as often as last year</li> 
                    <li>There are a lot of new stickers (on both the old and new machines)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Some think the amount of stickers is a bit excessive
                            </li>
                        </ul> 
                </ul>
                <li>Are the new machines easier to use compared to the older washing + drying machines?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some machines have no machine number and just have a 6 digit repair ID...the old machines have both...it's a bit confusing</li>
                        <li>New machines are not numbered like old machines</li>
                        <li>2 machines are old and just got new stickers...we could have gotten two more free machines</li>
                        <li>Still have no idea what the maximum load is...</li>
                        <li>New machines are not more easy to use...but they do provide FREE laundry.</li>
                        <li>The new machines allow you to just pick you cycle and go...no need to pay anymore...although this isn't evident at first</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>How would you describe your experience using these new machines?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Initially many thought they couldn't use the new machines because the payment machine box said the machines were 'out of order'</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This, however, means laundry is free for now</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>The difference in machine numbering takes some time to learn. After the initial user errors/testing laundry is easy</li>
                        <li>There is a slight learning curve...instructions are not clear</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Do the new machines make doing laundry easier?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New machines have cause some initial confusion</li>
                        <li>New Machines are reliable</li>
                        <li>New Machines are not broken yet</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Would you change anything about the current setup?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More instructions are needed for payment part of doing laundry</li>
                        <li>The stickers seem excessive and a bit too much</li>
                    </ul>

            This storyboard details Terry's first laundry experience within Machado. Terry is unsure whether he has to pay for laundry and is unfamiliar with the machines in Machado. Terry experienced many errors only to reach the conclusion that laundry is free within Machado--unlike his experience at his previous college.
